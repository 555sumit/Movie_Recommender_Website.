## About

Movie Recommender is a web application designed to provide tailored movie suggestions to users. It leverages various recommendation algorithms (which can be elaborated on if specific algorithms are used, e.g., content-based, collaborative filtering) to help users explore a vast library of movies and find their next favorite watch. The front-end is built with standard web technologies for a responsive and intuitive user experience, while the back-end handles the recommendation logic and data processing using Python.

## Features

* **Search Functionality:** Easily search for movies by title.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Get movie suggestions based on your input (e.g., favorite genres, previously watched movies, or a simple rating system).
* **Movie Details:** View detailed information about each movie, including synopsis, genre, release date, and ratings.
* **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
    * **CSS3:** For styling and layout, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.
    * **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, dynamic content loading, and client-side logic.
* **Backend:**
    * **Python 3.x:** For implementing the recommendation algorithms, data processing, and serving API requests.
        * `Django` - Web framework for handling requests and responses.
        * `Pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis.
        * `scikit-learn` - Machine learning library for recommendation algorithms (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer`, `cosine_similarity`).
        * `requests` - For making HTTP requests to external movie APIs (e.g., TMDB).
* **Database (Optional):**
    *SQL

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git](https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git)
    cd movie-recommender
    ```

2.  **Set up the Python environment:**

    It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` yet, you'll need to create one. For example:*

    ```bash
    # Create requirements.txt manually with your installed packages
    # Or generate it after installing dependencies:
    # pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Obtain API Key (if applicable):**

    If your project uses an external movie database API (e.g., TMDB, OMDb), you'll need to:
    * Sign up for an API key.
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or a similar configuration method) and add your API key:
        ```
        API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    * *(Ensure you have a library like `python-dotenv` installed to load these environment variables in your Python code.)*

## Usage

1.  **Start the Python backend server:**

    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    python app.py  # Or whatever your main Python file is named (e.g., main.py, server.py)
    ```

    You should see output indicating that the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (if using Flask).

2.  **Open the frontend in your browser:**

    Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the `index.html` file located in the `frontend` (or `public`, `static`) directory.

    Alternatively, if your backend server serves the static files:
    Navigate to the address where your backend is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

3.  **Interact with the website:**

    * Use the search bar to find movies.
    * Provide input (e.g., select genres, rate movies) to get personalized recommendations.
    * Click on movie posters or titles to view detailed information.

## Project Structure
* All file are stored in a single folder.
